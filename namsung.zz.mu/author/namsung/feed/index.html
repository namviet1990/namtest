<p>Apple today <a href="https://jobs.apple.com/us/search#&amp;t=1&amp;sb=req_open_dt&amp;so=1&amp;lo=0*USA&amp;pN=2&amp;openJobId=30456958">posted</a> a job listing on its website looking for a Payments Software Engineer that will “help build a next generation payment platform.” Apple says the payment system will consist of integration of payment devices, middleware and acquirers that will “push the boundaries in new markets for Apple Retail.”</p>
<div id="author-ad"></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple is interested in experts in eCommerce, banking, retail, and card industries and lists various payment technologies including Chip&amp;Pin, bank messaging specifications, country specific technologies such as EFTPOS (AUS) and Interac (CAN), and testing solutions used by Visa, Mastercard and others including ADVT, M-TIP, AEIPS, and Interac testing.</p>
<p>Apple currently uses a custom housing for the iPod touch with a combination of third-party hardware to process payments in its retail stores. Apple also has its Apple Store iOS app that lets users purchase products for personal pickup or quickly scan and purchase accessories when in a retail store. We already reported the company has some big plans for retail in the near future with its new Bluetooth 4.0 powered iBeacons technology. We recent reported that Apple <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/11/16/apple-stores-to-implement-ibeacon-location-technology-to-improve-service-boost-sales/">is installing its iBeacon transmitters in retail stores in the U.S.</a> with plans of beaming promotions and other relevant info to customers walking around the store. As more and more big companies take advantage of iBeacons and even start offering the <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2013/09/27/ibeacon-briefing-what-is-it-and-what-can-we-expect-from-it/">ability to complete payments using the technology</a>, perhaps iBeacons will play a role in Apple’s new payment platform for retail. It would certainly be a great opportunity for Apple to finally introduce its own payment system, a competitor to the NFC-based Google Wallet for example, but we’ll have to wait to find out for sure what Apple has planned.<br />

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple today released an unlocked GSM version of the iPhone 5s on its online store for the United States. This version of the iPhone 5s includes the same exact capabilities of the non-unlocked models, but does not include a SIM card. Users who buy this version of the iPhone will need to supply their own SIM card. The central benefit of an unlocked iPhone is that it can work on many GSM networks across the globe with no contract. For frequent world travelers, this option is worth looking into… This unlocked model works on AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in the United States, and also means that you will not need a contract with those carriers if you buy this specific model. The SIM-free iPhone 5s comes in 16GB, 32GB, and 64GB capacities for $649, $749, and $849, and it comes in the same space gray, silver, and gold color options as the carrier-tied versions. The models ship in 1-2 weeks from Apple’s online store, and should become available in Apple retail stores in the coming weeks. Since launch, Apple has sold an unlocked variant of the iPhone 5s for T-Mobile. However, that model includes a T-Mobile SIM card and could potentially be tied to a T-Mobile account. Today’s release includes no SIM card. This is also different than an AT&amp;T/GSM model because that device is tied to an AT&amp;T contract even at full price. A customer would need to manually unlock that device to get the same effect as today’s new offering. In essence, today’s SIM-free model works the same way as other unlocked iPhone 5s units, but it comes with no SIM card and is completely unlocked the moment you turn it on. A SIM-free version of the iPhone 5c has been available since its launch in September. Many international countries have had availability of the fully unlocked iPhone 5s for several weeks.</p>
